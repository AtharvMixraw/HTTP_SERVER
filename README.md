# Ironnet - Simple HTTP Server

Ironnet is a simple HTTP server implementation written in C++ for Linux systems. It allows you to serve basic web pages and handle HTTP requests.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **http_linuxserver.cpp**: Contains the main logic for the HTTP server implementation. It handles socket creation, accepting connections, reading client requests, and sending responses.
2. **http_tcpserver_linux.h**: Header file containing the declaration of the `TcpServer` class, which encapsulates the functionality of the HTTP server.
3. **server_linux.cpp**: The entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the `TcpServer` class and starts listening for incoming connections.

## How to Use

To use Ironnet, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ http_linuxserver.cpp server_linux.cpp -o ironnet
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable:
   ```bash
   ./ironnet
   ```
4. The server will start listening for incoming connections on the specified IP address and port (default is 0.0.0.0:8080).

## Features

- **Basic HTTP Server**: Ironnet provides a basic HTTP server functionality, allowing you to serve simple web pages.
- **Configurable**: You can configure the IP address and port on which the server listens by providing the appropriate parameters during server instantiation.
- **Logging**: Ironnet logs important server events and errors to the console, making it easier to debug and monitor.

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include "http_tcpServer_linux.h"

int main() {
    using namespace http;
    // Create an instance of TcpServer with IP address "0.0.0.0" and port 8080
    TcpServer server = TcpServer("0.0.0.0", 8080);
    // Start listening for incoming connections
    server.startListen();
    return 0;
}
```
